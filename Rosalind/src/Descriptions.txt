CONS.java: Consensus and Profile
  Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.
  Returns: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of them.)
  
FIBD.java: Mortal Fibonacci Rabbits
  Given: Positive integers n ≤ 100 and m ≤ 20.
  Returns: The total number of pairs of rabbits that will remain after the n-th month if all rabbits live for m months.
  Notes: Solved recursively 

GRPH.java: Overlap Graphs
  Given: A collection of DNA strings in FASTA format having total length at most 10 kbp. 
  Returns: The adjacency list corresponding to O3. You may return edges in any order.
  Notes: O3 corresponds with the overlap of prefix and suffixes for particular pairs of strings being 3 characters in length.

IPRB.java: Mendel's First Law
  Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.
  Returns: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
  
SUBS.java: Finding a Motif in DNA
  Given: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).
  Return: All locations of t as a substring of s.
  Note: Utilized a Boyer's Moore substring implementation
